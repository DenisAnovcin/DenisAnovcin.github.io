                <div class="item-2"><p><bold>1:</bold> River between Hungary and Slovakia <br><br>
                    This picture above was taken from the castle in Esztergom, Hungary. Esztergom is a town situated in northern Hungary, bordering Slovakia. Esztergom is divided from Slovakia by the Danube river which represents the border of both countries. Right across Esztergom, on the other side of the river, is the Slovakian town of Stúrovo and these two are connected by the Mária Valéria bridge (seen on the picture). <br>
                    The idea behind this picture is how fluid borders can be. In this case, the simple crossing of a bridge equals crossing the borders of countries. Since both countries are in the European Union and are situated in Central Europe, border control can be quiet flexible however in the last couple of months both countries have increased control at their borders due to migrant crossings (Spike, 2023). The interesting factor in this is the movement from one side of a river to the other can determine what country you are in, what laws and rules apply to you etc. even though said movement is only about 500 metres.

                <div class="item-4"><p><bold>2:</bold> Meeting point of the two tectonic plates <br><br>
                    This picture was taken on the Reykjanes peninsula, in Iceland, where the Northern American and Eurasian tectonic plates meet. The planet's outer layer is broken into large rock plates that are the cause of many natural formations such as mountains, volcanoes etc. and the meeting point of two of these plates happens to be through the middle of Iceland. The tectonic plates are constantly moving either to or from each other and these movements are the cause of the many earthquakes in Iceland and in the world. <br>
                    This meeting point of the plates represent a kind of natural border since it can determine landscapes which can influence territorial ambitions of state leaders. These movements over time can lead to the detachment of land and the creation of islands and other mainlands even. Even though islands are usually under the control of other governments, if the population of the island increases, it may lead to independence ambitions, which creates new borders. There have been speculations that the Reykjanes peninsula in Iceland may indeed may break off in the future - will that lead to border complications?</p></div>

                <div class="item-6"><p><bold>3:</bold> Reykjavik Airport <br><br>
                    This picture is of the main Icelandic International Airport, in Keflavík, Iceland. The Keflavík Airport is substantially smaller than other European airports due the size of the Icelandic population and its infrastructural system. Even though the actual size of the island is bigger that some countries in Europe, including Hungary and Slovakia, its economical size leads to the country being pretty isolated in the sense of connectional points such as airports and harbours. There are only two international airports on the island where international flights operate and even though the number of ports is higher, the country is still significantly more detached from Europe than other countries on the continent. <br>
                    Since the flow of people in and out of the country happens mainly through Keflavík Airport, border control in Iceland can be regulated quite simply. As happened in 2020, when the covid-19 pandemic swept over the world, the borders of the country were closed, including the airport, and the number of foreigners who arrived to the island was much lower than in the previous years. In islands, like Iceland, the meaning of borders is therefore a much more flexible phenomena that in countries bordering others directly since its role of connecting countries and people can weaken so rapidly. <br><br>
 
                    <em>Fun fact: the art piece seen on the picture is said to represent the end of the rainbow - another border?</em>

                <div class="item-8"><p><bold>4:</bold> Öresundsbron <br><br>
                    This is Öresundsbron, a bridge that spans between Copenhagen on the Danish side and the city of Malmö on the Swedish side (Wikipedia, 2024). Inaugurated in the year 2000, the bridge has opened up possibilities for both Swedish and Danish citizens in numerous ways. It has enriched the student life, given possibilities for work, and in general been a tool to connect people from different national identities. But it has not only served as a physical bridge between people, it has also served as a psychological one. Around the time of its inauguration, the bridge served as a symbol of the political will to create a “transnational region” between Sweden and Denmark (Garro, 2021). Although this did not quite happen, the aim was clear- to connect people and create ties. The bridge was more than a bridge, it was a symbol of the want for affinity between nationalities (Ibid). <br>
                    Öresundsbron has, as mentioned above, given thousands of people extended opportunities for work, education, and social life. But it is also a reminder of how fragile the connection we have created is. The bridge has, for example, been, identified as a likely target if terrorism were to strike in the southern parts of Sweden. What took nine years to construct can be torn down in an instant.

                <div class="item-10"><p><bold>5:</bold> The port of Gothenburg <br><br>
                    This is a part of the old port in Gothenburg, which has been operational for more than 400 years. The port of Gothenburg is the largest one in Scandinavia and has given the city international status as a hub for trade. But it is not only trade that has put the port on the map- the port of Gothenburg also housed the Swedish American Line which did monthly trips to North America during the early 1900's, carrying Swedes out into the world (Göteborgs hamn AB, n.d). <br>
                    The port of Gothenburg has made it into the city it is today. The old cranes that adorn the city's skyline today remind us of a time when the port was one of the few bridges to the rest of the world. But just as most of the infrastructure we humans built, the port is vulnerable. During the Second World War, the port was believed to be of strategic importance to the Germans. Because of this, plans were made to block the entrance to the port and blow up the nearby bridge to make sure it would not fall into German hands. Although this would protect the port, it would also take away its purpose- to connect people and goods from all over the world.

                <div class="item-12"><p><bold>6:</bold> Slovak broadcasting building <br><br>
                    This is the Slovak Radio Building. It is located in Bratislava and is an interesting piece of architecture that went against the Soviet-styled norm of the time. It has hosted regular broadcasts since 1985 and currently serves as the headquarters of the Radio and Television of Slovakia (Visitbratislava, n.d). When speaking on themes of borders and bridges, we are not only referring to the physical ones. The technological leaps we have taken during the last 100 years or so have blurred these borders, natural and human-made, even more. The opportunity to broadcast opinions, news, and culture over a vast distance is a powerful means to create connections between people from all over- for better or worse. Digital mediums are not only a tool for blurring borders and connecting people. It is also a medium that can, and has historically, been used to sever the connections between people and put up 'borders' between us. Depending on how it is used, radio and television (and other media) can be used both as a border and a means of connection between people.

                <div class="item-14"><p><bold>7:</bold> Wasaline, ferry between Umeå in Sweden and Vaasa in Finland <br><br>
                    The ferry showcased in this image, Aurora Botnia, represents the latest addition to Wasaline's fleet, jointly owned by Umeå and Vaasa. Navigating the waters of Kvarken in the Gulf of Bothnia, it serves as a vital link between Umeå on Sweden's east coast and Vaasa on the west coast of Finland. <br>
                    Completing its port-to-port journey in just 3,5 hours, the ferry has become a catalyst for significant cooperation between Swedes and Finns. Many Swedish-speaking Finns, facing language barriers, have chosen Umeå for studies, leading to improved cross-cultural collaboration. Local companies find enhanced ease in cooperation, and Finnish tourism, with daily trips across the sea, has significantly contributed to improving Umeå's economy. Wasaline itself has also joined the Swedish shipping company, “Svensk sjöfart”, which focuses on environmental solutions, emphasizing an aspect of the improved connection between Sweden and Finland. <br>
                    Beyond benefiting Finns and Swedes, the ferry plays an important role for truck drivers not only from Finland but also Russia and the Baltics, effectively shortening their journeys to Northern Sweden and Norway. <br>
                    Building on the foundation laid by the ferry, Umeå and Vaasa, despite being in different countries, have initiated a deepening cooperative agreement, culminating in a joint development strategy plan as of 2023. Focused on improving residents' quality of life and creating opportunities for local companies and organisations (Yle, 2023), this collaboration has evolved from the ferry's initial role. <br>
                    While the ferry connects the two countries both economically and educationally, the potential for interruptions, whether from personnel strikes, financial challenges, or accidents, underscores the vulnerability of this singular transportation link, emphasising its critical importance for the region.

                <div class="item-16"><p><bold>8:</bold> Helsingør and Helsingborg <br><br>
                    This picture is taken from Helsingør on the east coast of Denmark, offering a view of Helsingborg on the west coast of Sweden. The Øresund, measuring only 3.5 kilometres in width between the two cities (Länsstyrelsen, 2022), has been a historic passageway for almost a thousand years, referenced by author Adam of Bremen as early as back in 1070 (Kärnan, n.d.). This ferry link, deeply embedded in the trade history between the two cities, has played a crucial role in transporting goods and people. <br>
                    The ferry connection and the Øresund not only symbolise a historical transportation link but also reflect the shared destinies of two cities that have faced both cooperation and conflict. The Swedish-Danish wars of the 17th and 18th centuries, concluding with Helsingborg permanently becoming part of Sweden, add another layer to the historical challenges these cities endured. <br>
                    Today, the cultural exchange between them is a significant draw for tourists. Landmarks like Sofiero Castle in Helsingborg and Kronborg Castle in Helsingør stand as cultural symbols. Sofiero, known for its beautiful gardens, and Kronborg, honoured as 'Elsinore' in Shakespeare’s 'Hamlet,' attract visitors, contributing to the tourism and cultural ties between the two cities. <br>
                    The ferry line itself serves as a physical link to the shared history between Helsingborg and Helsingør. The Øresund, a perfect opportunity of cooperation for the cities, reflects the past and the present. The challenges endured by the cities may have strengthened their bond, transforming the border between Helsingborg and Helsingør into more than a geographical division but a witness to what you can achieve by overcoming regional challenges.

              <P>Throughout history, humankind has found ways to connect. We have overcome mountains, oceans, rivers, weather- obstacles of all kinds. All these natural borders have tried their best to keep us apart- yet we have found ways around, over, under, and through them. By building bridges we have crossed rivers. By building ports and ships we have crossed oceans. By building airports and aircraft we have created opportunities to connect with people on the other side of the globe in a matter of hours, and with modern technology such as smartphones these natural borders have been even more blurred. Yet it is important to think about how fragile all of the infrastructure and technology that has given us these opportunities is. They can be destroyed a hundred times faster than they are built. Recent events, such as the war in Ukraine, are a frightening example of this. In conflict, the bridges, ports, and airports are seen as targets because of their purpose- they connect us. It is important to remember that the natural borders of the world were once impenetrable for humankind and that the infrastructure we built is very fragile. The connection that took so long to build can be torn down in a heartbeat.</P>
